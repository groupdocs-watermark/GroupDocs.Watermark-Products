      "step_1": "**Streamline Secure Watermarking in Your {{EnvName}} Applications:** The **Watermarker** class acts as the core component of the {{ProdShortName}} API. This library simplifies watermarks generation various document formats, including {{FileformatCap}}. To get started, create a Watermarker instance before processing your document. Provide the {{FileformatCap}} file path or a stream object to the constructor during initialization.",
      "step_2": "**Generate Watermarks for Enhanced Protection:** Empower watermarks that perfectly align with your security needs. Construct a **Watermark** object specifying the desired type. Unlike traditional page placement, you can embed watermarks within native document elements like headers or attachments, fortifying document security and adding a professional touch.",
      "step_3": "**Fine-Tune Watermark Appearance for Optimal Impact:** Control the visual aspects of your watermarks. Customize properties such as height, width, alignment (top, left, center, etc.), font families, and colors to achieve a visually effective and consistent outcome that reinforces document legitimacy.",
      "step_4": "**Watermark Application and Secure Storage**: Incorporate your watermarks using the **Watermarker's** method. The library allows you to add multiple watermarks if necessary for enhanced protection. It's recommended to save the modified {{FileformatCap}} document to a separate, secure location to preserve the original file and safeguard your watermarked documents."
