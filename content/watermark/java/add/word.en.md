      **[GroupDocs.Watermark for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/watermark/java/)** makes it easy for Java developers to add watermarks of various types to popular business file formats. Add our library to your application and watermark documents in a few easy steps as listed below.
      
      1. The main class of our API is **Watermarker**. You need to instantiate it before document processing. Do not forget to pass the Word file to the constructor as a path or a stream object.
      2. The next step is constructing a **Watermark** object of the desired type. It can be placed not only on a specific document page but also in native document parts like attachments or headers.
      3. Set watermark properties such as height and width, page alignment (top, left, central, etc.), font family and color, and many others.
      4. Call the **Watermarker** method to add a new watermark. You can add as many watermarks as you need. It is recommended to save the processed document to another location.
