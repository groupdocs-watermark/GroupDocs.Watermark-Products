    title: "Programmatically Remove Watermarks from Rtf Documents using .NET"
    content: |
      **[GroupDocs.Watermark](https://products.groupdocs.com/watermark/net/)** empowers .NET developers to programmatically remove watermarks from various Rtf documents. This guide outlines the process:
      
      1. Initiate the workflow by supplying your Rtf file as an argument to the **Watermarker** class constructor. The file can be provided as either a byte stream, a file stream, or a reference to a local disk location.
      2. Leverage the power of the **SearchCriteria** object to identify the specific watermarks requiring removal. This object enables the filtering of watermarks based on properties previously embedded within the document. You can utilize an image as a search parameter alongside text or formatting attributes for a highly granular search.
      3. Following a successful search, you'll receive a collection of relevant watermarks. These watermarks offer granular control, allowing you to perform the removal operation.
      4. Upon completion of watermark removal, persist the modified document. The API facilitates storage using either a local file path or a stream object.
